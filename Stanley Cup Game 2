            <h2>Oilers vs. Panthers Game 2: Your Moneyline Pick and 3 Hilarious Prop Bets</h2>
            <p>For tonight's Game 2 between the Edmonton Oilers and the Florida Panthers, here are three prop bets that will not only make you money but also keep you laughing:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Connor McDavid to Score a Goal</h3>
            <p>Betting on McDavid to score is like betting the sun will rise. The guy skates like he’s late for dinner, and he was all over the place in Game 1. McDavid scoring is more reliable than your morning coffee, so put your money on him finding the back of the net.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Total Goals Over 6.5</h3>
            <p>Both teams can score faster than a Vegas wedding. Game 1 was just a taste of the chaos to come. With McDavid and Draisaitl on one side and Barkov and Bobrovsky (when he's not busy doing his best Swiss cheese impression) on the other, expect the puck to spend more time in the net than a lazy cat. Go big on the over.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Leon Draisaitl Over 1.5 Points</h3>
            <p>Draisaitl was everywhere in Game 1, dishing out assists like Oprah giving away cars. "You get a goal! You get a goal!" Betting on him to rack up points is like betting on gravity—it’s just going to happen. Two points? Easy money, because Draisaitl is the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
            
            <p>These prop bets will have you grinning all the way to the bank. Expect goals, drama, and plenty of reasons to laugh your way through Game 2.</p>
